# AI-Driven Threat Detection System

This project is an AI-driven threat detection system designed to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and detect potential intrusions.

### Files

- **preprocessing.py**: Contains code for loading and preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing features.
- **feature_selection.py**: Implements feature selection using a Random Forest classifier to identify the most important features for threat detection.
- **model_training.py**: Includes code for training and evaluating a machine learning model (Random Forest) on the selected features.
- **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ai-threat-detection.git]
   cd ai-threat-detection
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your dataset in the project directory and update the `file_path` variable in the scripts with the path to your dataset.

2. Run the preprocessing script to load and preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

3. Run the feature selection script to identify the most important features:
   ```bash
   python feature_selection.py
   ```

4. Run the model training script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```

5. Alternatively, you can run the main script to execute the entire process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
